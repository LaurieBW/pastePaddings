# Paste Paddings

## Installation

### Usage

This sketch plugin copies the paddings of one element to another. It can speed up your workflow when you’ve changed the spacing of one element that’s shared across different artboards and would like the new spacing to be applied to the same element in other artboards.

- Select an element.
- Hit `ctrl + shift + c` to copy its paddings.
- Select another element, typically in another artboard.
- Hit `ctrl + shift + v` to paste the new paddings.
